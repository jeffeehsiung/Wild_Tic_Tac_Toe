The screenshot you've uploaded shows the file structure of your AR Tic-Tac-Toe app in Xcode. Each item represents a different component of your project, and I'll explain what each one typically contains:

- **README**: This file is usually a text file containing information about your project, how to set it up, run it, and any other important details.

- **AppDelegate**: This is a class that contains methods that are essential for the **lifecycle** of the app. It receives events from the system like **app start, termination, backgrounding**, etc.

- **ViewController**: This class manages a single view within your app. It is likely to contain a significant **portion of the logic related to user interactions and UI updates**, especially in simple apps with one main screen.

- **Assets**: This is a collection of the images, icons, and any other visual or audio assets that your app uses.

- **LaunchScreen**: This is a **storyboard or XIB file** that defines the **appearance** of the app's **launch screen**, which is the first screen shown when your app starts up.

- **Info.plist**: This is a configuration file that contains essential **metadata** about your app, such as its version number, display name, and permissions.

- **Dimensions.swift**: This file likely contains **constants** or other information regarding the **dimensions** used within the app, such as **sizes for UI elements or spacing**.

- **Figure.swift**: This could be the file that **represents the "O" and "X" figures**, possibly including how they are drawn or how they interact within the game.

- **GameState.swift**: This is likely a file that **manages the state** of the game, tracking which **player's turn** it is, whether someone has **won**, or if the game is a **draw**.

- **GameAI.swift**: This file probably contains the **logic for the computer** opponent, **determining moves** when the user is playing against the device.

- **Extensions.swift**: This file might contain Swift extensions, which are a way to add **additional functionality to existing classes, structures, enumerations, or protocols**.

- **Board.swift**: This file would **manage the tic-tac-toe board**, including functions for **placing figures** on the board, **checking for a win**, and **clearing** the board for a new game.

- **media_sources**: This folder might contain media resources that are used within the app, such as videos, sound files, or other large media assets.

- **Main**: This is typically the main storyboard file, where you visually lay out the UI components of your app and define the flow between different screens.

This structure suggests a fairly **standard MVC** (Model-View-Controller) architecture, where the **model** is represented by the **`GameState`**, **`Board`**, and **`Figure`** classes, the **view** is handled by the **`Main`** storyboard and associated **UI elements** in the `Assets`, and the **controller** logic is within the **`ViewController`**.
